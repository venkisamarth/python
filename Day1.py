# what is programming and prgramming languages?
# Diffrence between programming and coding 
# compiler and intepreter
# what is computer program? 
#set of instructions for the computer to follow and achive certine goal task 
# example 
# snake game 
# when snake eat foods it's lenght should high 
# when snake thuch itself  loose in this game 
# programing language is a means of communication between a human and the computer 
# Below tems we have 
# programs = set of instruction is called as program 
# programming = process of developing programs 
# programmer =person who develops the programs 
# programing language = computer language for insteruntions 


#process of programming 
# problem defination 
# algorithem design and planning 
# coding 
# Testing and DEbugging 
# Code opetimization 
# Maintanance 


# programming languages 
# Each programming languages has its own sysntax and rules 
# a Low -level languages 
# and second one is high levele longuages 

#Low level language

#These languages are closer to the machine's hardwars  and provides direct controle opver the comupter resource 
#assembly language 

# to do the addiion of the two numbers we need to write the pages ot the program in the assembly language 

# Hihg level language
# it is eassy to two write the language 

# python progam 
n1= 23 
n2=23 
print(n1+n2)


# input Translator program  compailer 
#nterpreter and  assembler 


# compailer and interpreter
