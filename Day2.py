# what is python 
# python is the high level progamming language like like c and c++ 
# types of progaming language 
# python is the simple ,high level,interpreted, general purpose ,dynamycally typed and object oriented  programming language created bu Guido Van Rossum in 1991 
# python is the older then the java language 
# 

# simple is simple 
#python is easy to use 
#python program are simple to write and hence it is easy 
#to learn 

# Lots of built in funciton we can use easy then the other programs 

# # hello world in java program in java 
# class Helloworld { 
#     static public void main (String args []){
#         system.out,println ("Hello world")
#     }
# }

# ## Hello world in c++ 
# # include <iostream.h>
# main () {  
#     cout<<"Hello world "<<endl;
#     return 0;

# }

# Hello world progam in pyhton 
print("Hello world this is the my first progam in the python ")

# python is the high -level

# More user -friendly 
# -- There is autometic memory managment 

# rich set of libraraies and funciton ex.len ()

# # python is the intepriter language 
# Final execution  of  the python program is done by interpreter 

# Interpreter scan the python program line by line
# 
# python file is run o
#python is the general purpose programming language 

#python is used for webddvelopment machine leraning artificial intelligence data aalysis data scince web development 
# scraping scripting scientificn computing softer deve etc 
# futeure of python 

# python is the dynamicaly typed language 
# age =10 
#age=20 

# this is the normla then it could be the problme then it shoul be the problem it could 
#line c and c++ we dont need to specify datatypes of identifiers 
# python evaluates datatypes at runtime 
# python is object oriented programing language 
# in this we can create class and objects 
# python supports nearly all concepts of objects oriented style 
# 
# every value in the python is the object of the own python class 
# buitl in or the user defined
